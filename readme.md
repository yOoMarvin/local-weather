#Local Weather App

This is a rework of my local weather project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). Did this in scope of the [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/yOoMarvin/100-days-of-code) challenge.

Full project is deployed to heroku and can be found [here](https://yoomarvin-local-weather.herokuapp.com/index.html)
